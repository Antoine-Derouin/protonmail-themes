# ProtonMail Themes
Since [v.1.16](https://blog.protonmail.ch/protonmail-beta-v1-16-release-notes/), the encrypted mail service now allows themes using the Cascading Style Sheets! So feel free to pick one and use it.

### How to use these
Simply pick one from the themes folder and copy the code over to ProtonMail by heading over to **settings>theme**, paste the code under the *CSS Theme Code* section.


### Like to build themes?
I would gladly post any themes made by you in order to make this repository grow so please feel free to [send your themes over to us](http://www.csalmeida.com/) and be part of this project.
