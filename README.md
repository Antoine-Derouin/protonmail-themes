# ProtonMail Themes
Since [v1.16](https://blog.protonmail.ch/protonmail-beta-v1-16-release-notes/), the encrypted mail service now allows themes using the Cascading Style Sheets! So feel free to pick one and use it. Now with [v3.5.16](https://blog.protonmail.ch/protonmail-beta-v2-0-release-notes/) comes updated theme goodness.

## Version 3.0 of ProtonMail is here! (v3.5.16 to be precise)

### How to use these
Simply pick one from the themes folder and copy the code over to ProtonMail by heading over to **Settings**, click the **Appearance** tab and paste the code under the *Custom Theme* section and press save.
The theme should be applied.
